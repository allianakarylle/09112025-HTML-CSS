            [Verse 1]
            We're talking away
            No, I don't know what I'm to say
            I'll say it anyway
            Today is another day to find you
            Shyin' away
            I'll be comin' for your love, okay?

            [Chorus]
            Take on me (Take on me)
            Take me on (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two

            [Verse 2]
            So, needless to say
            I'm odds and ends
            But I'll be stumblin' away
            Slowly learnin' that life is okay
            Say after me
            "It's no better to be safe than sorry"

            [Chorus]
            Take on me (Take on me)
            Take me on (Take on me)
            I'll be gone
            In a day or two
